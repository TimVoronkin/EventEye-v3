This is an EventEye project I developed as a semester project at my university.
It is a website application for sharing and organizing photos.

- Backendwas done through IntelliJ IDEA, with SpringBoot in Java
- Database used was My SQL.
- Frontend was done through VScode, using npm module - Angular.

If everything is installed correctly, then to fully run the application you need:
1. In the IntelliJ interface run the file “\Shopping\src\main\java\com\Shoppingproject\Shopping\Shopping\ShoppingApplication.java”.
2. In the terminal of the Web folder, write "ng serve"
3. In the Browser, open "http://localhost:4200/"
