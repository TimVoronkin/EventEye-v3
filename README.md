This is an EventEye project I developed as a semester project at my university.
It is a website application for sharing and organizing photos.

- Backend was done through **IntelliJ IDEA**, with **SpringBoot** in **Java**
- Database is through **MySQL**.
- Frontend was done through **VScode**, using npm module - **Angular**.


If everything is installed correctly, then to fully run the application you need:
1. In the IntelliJ interface run the file `\Shopping\src\main\java\com\Shoppingproject\Shopping\Shopping\ShoppingApplication.java`.
2. In the terminal of `ShoppingWeb` folder, write `ng serve`
3. In the Browser, open `http://localhost:4200/`
